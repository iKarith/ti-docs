# TI-99/4A Documentation

This is all pretty bare-bones for now since ... nothing has really been
written yet.  BUT!  This repository shall contain a few documents to help you
get started with the fun and quirky vintage computer, the Texas Instruments
TI-99/4A.  We're going to assume here that either you have not actually seen
one of these things since 1983, or perhaps that you have never seen one
before.

Eventually the goal is to replace the "Read Me First" guide that would've
originally come with the console with something new and useful in 2016 and
beyond, but also eventually recreate the original manuals that came with the
system for reference.  It's a big job.  If you can help, please do.  You can
always ask iKarith for help using git or GitHub if you need it.

Thanks!
